Rule Generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Rule generation technique is based on the idea below:

1. Sort all APIs used in an APK by their usage counts.
2. Separate all APIs into two groups, P(20% least usage count) and S(other 80% APIs), by the Pareto principle (20-80 rule).
3. Combine $P$ and $S$ into four different phases:
    - PxP
    - PxS 
    - SxP 
    - SxS
4. Execute the rule generation with each phase in this order: PxP -> PxS -> SxP -> SxS

The earlier the phase, the higher the value of the rule but less time spent.
We can generate rules in a phased manner according to different situations.
For example, under a time constraint, we can take PxP phase rules as an overview for the target APK.

CLI Usage
------------------------
Generate rules for APK with the following command::

    $ quark -a <sample path> --generate-rule <generated rule directory path>

Generate rules and web editor with the following command::

    $ quark -a <sample path> --generate-rule <generated rule directory path> -w <web editor file name>


API Usage
-----------------------------------

And here is the simplest way for API usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from quark.rulegeneration import RuleGeneration

    # The target APK.
    APK_PATH = "Ahmyth.apk"

    # The output directory for generated rules.
    GENERATED_RULE_DIR = "generated_rules"

    generator = RuleGeneration(APK_PATH, GENERATED_RULE_DIR)
    generator.generate_rule(web_editor="report.html")


Web Editor Tutorial
-----------------------------------

Here is the demo for the rule generation web editor.
You can easily review and edit generated rules with 5 steps:

1. Input keywords to search rules.
2. Select the generated rules you want to save.
3. Edit rule information.

4. Edit crime, score, and labels with the editor.
5. Save the edited rule.
