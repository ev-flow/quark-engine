Quark Script Team 
==================

The Quark Script Team is dedicated to the continual improvement of the Quark Script API. Our mission encompasses the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the API, documentation, and Quark Script Repo. We focus on developing methodologies for effective auditing and optimization, aiming to make the Quark Script API user-friendly, practical, and easily comprehensible for developers, contributors, and users.

Quark Script Team Operation Mechanism

Our approach integrates development, maintenance, and optimization of the Quark Script API. This comprehensive strategy covers both coding and documentation aspects.

* Code Aspect:
    - Development & Maintenance: We start by focusing on the development and regular upkeep of the Quark Script API.
    - Audit & Optimize: Following development, we conduct thorough audits and apply optimization techniques to enhance quality.
    - Practical Application: We identify areas for further refinement in real-world applications and circle back to development for continuous improvement.

* Documentation Aspect:
    - Authoring: Initial efforts involve creating clear and detailed API documentation.
    - Audit & Optimize: Similar to code, we audit and optimize the documentation to ensure its quality and readability.
    - Practical Application: Feedback from practical application helps us pinpoint areas for improvement in documentation, leading to subsequent revisions and enhancements.

2024 Quark Script Team Plan
---------------------------

* Q1: Audit and Optimization
    Focus on developing and refining audit and optimization methodologies for both the Quark Script API code and its documentation.
    Implement a complete cycle of these methodologies to ensure the highest standards.

* Q2: Development, Maintenance, and Documentation Enhancement
    Post-audit, emphasize further development and maintenance of the Quark Script API.
    Apply lessons from the audit phase to refine our development and documentation practices.

* Q3: Practical Application and Feedback Integration
    Engage in real-world application scenarios to identify unseen challenges.
    Utilize these insights for targeted development and documentation enhancements.

* Q4: Comprehensive Review and Strategy Refinement
    Review the year's methodologies and outcomes, focusing on development, maintenance, practical application, and auditing processes.
    Use these insights to refine our overall approach, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.
    This revised version aims to eliminate redundancy, clarify processes, and provide a more structured approach to the Quark Script Team's operations and plans.

Quark triage team
=================

The Quark triage team handles more than just triage. They are the managers of the Quark organization. They define processes for handling issues/PRs, manage Quark releases. And the most important of all, they communicate with community members.

Responsibilities
----------------
``Version: v1.0``

* Management of issues within the Quark Github organization, including:
    - Review, close issues and apply appropriate labels for issues.
    - Resolve minor issues (typo, usage problem, ask about the Quarkâ€™s techniques).
    - Initiate a discussion with other members if the issues are major changes.
    - Define and revise the process for handling issues.

* Management of PRs within the Quark Github organization, including:
    - Review, merging PRs and applying appropriate labels for PRs.
    - Initiate a discussion with other members if the PRs are major changes.
    - Define and revise the process for handling PRs.

* Management of Quark releases on Kali/PyPi/Github, including:
     - Generate and create releases.
     - Test releases.
     - Define and revise the process and determine the content for releases.

Triage process
---------------
``Version: v1.1``

When Quark received an issue, the triage process is as below:

.. note::
    **If the issue is unable to reproduce, and the issue raiser hasn't responded.**

    - **Over one month**, the assignee should apply the label ``more-info-require`` to the issue and ask for more information.
    - **Over two months**, the assignee should apply the label ``invalid`` to the issue and close it.

When Quark received a PR, the triage process is as below:
