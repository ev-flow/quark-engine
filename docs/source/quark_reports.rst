Summary Report
--------------

Examine with rules.

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a 14d9f1a92dd984d6040cc41ed06e273e.apk -s

There is the possibility to select only one label to filter the rules:

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a 14d9f1a92dd984d6040cc41ed06e273e.apk -s network


There is also the possibility to select only one rule:

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a 14d9f1a92dd984d6040cc41ed06e273e.apk -s <path_to_the_rule>

Note that if you want to select the default rules of Quark, the path to the ruleset is ``$HOME/.quark-engine/quark-rules/rules/``.

Detail Report
-------------

This is how we examine a real android malware (candy corn) with one single rule (crime).

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a 14d9f1a92dd984d6040cc41ed06e273e.apk -d


There is the possibility to select only one label to filter the rules:

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a 14d9f1a92dd984d6040cc41ed06e273e.apk -d network


There is also the possibility to select only one rule:

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a 14d9f1a92dd984d6040cc41ed06e273e.apk -d <path_to_the_rule>

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/LFLFpvc.png

Note that if you want to select the default rules of Quark, the path to the ruleset is ``$HOME/.quark-engine/quark-rules/rules/``.

Web Report
----------------

With the following command, you can easily analyze the Android sample and output the web report. See our demo `here <https://pulorsok.github.io/ruleviewer/web-report-demo>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    quark -a sample.apk -s -w quark_report.html

Label-based Report
------------------

Check which topic (indicated by `labels <https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-rules/blob/master/label_desc.csv>`_) of the malware is more aggressive.

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a Ahmyth.apk -l detailed

Behaviors Comparison Radar Chart
--------------------------------

With the following command, you can compare different APK actions based on the max confidence of rule labels and generate a radar chart.

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a first.apk -a second.apk -C

Call Graph
----------

You can add the ``-g`` option to the quark command, and you can get the call graph (only those rules match with 100% confidence).

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a Ahmyth.apk -s -g

Rule Classification
--------------------

You can add the ``-c`` option to the quark command, and you can output the rules classification with the mutual parent function (only those rules match with 100% confidence).

.. code-block:: bash

    quark -a Ahmyth.apk -s -c
